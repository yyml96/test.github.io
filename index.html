      <h3>
        <li>What are the obligatory elements in each (X)HTML document?</li>
      </h3>
      <p>Each XHTML document must have the following elements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A doctype declaration indicating that the document is written in
          XHTML.
        </li>
        <li>
          The html element, which serves as the root element of the document.
        </li>
        <li>The head element, which contains metadata about the document.</li>
        <li>
          The title element, which provides a title for the document that is
          displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.
        </li>
        <li>
          The body element, which contains the content of the document that is
          displayed in the browser window. It is also good practice to include
          the xmlns attribute on the html element,to specify the XML namespace
          for the document.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><li>What's DOCTYPE declaration meant for?</li></h3>
      <p>
        The DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction to the web browser about what
        version of HTML or XHTML the document is written in. It is used to
        ensure that the browser renders the content correctly, by specifying the
        Document Type Definition (DTD) that the document conforms to. The DTD
        defines the rules for the markup language, such as what elements and
        attributes are available, and how they can be used. The browser uses the
        DTD to validate the document and ensure that it is well-formed and
        follows the correct syntax.

        <li>
          What is an URL? Give examples both of use of absolute and relative
          URLs.
        </li>
      </h3>
      <p>
        A URL, or uniform resource locator, is a string of text that identifies
        the location of a resource on the internet, such as a webpage, image, or
        file. A URL typically includes the protocol (such as http or https), the
        domain name, and the path to the resource.
      </p>
      <h4>An Absolute URL</h4>
      <p>
        An absolute URL includes the full address of the resource, including the
        protocol and domain name. For example:
        <a href="https://www.lab.fi/en/info">https://www.lab.fi/en/info</a> This
        URL specifies that the resource can be accessed using the HTTPS protocol
        and the domain name <a href="http://www.lab.fi">www.lab.fi</a>, and that
        the resource is located in the
        <a href="https://www.lab.fi/en/info">"en/info"</a> directory.
      </p>
      <h4>A Relative URL</h4>
      <p>
        A relative URL, on the other hand, does not include the protocol and
        domain name and instead, it's based on the location of the current page.
        For example: <a href="https://www.lab.fi/en/info">"en/info"</a> This URL
        specifies that the resource is located in the
        <a href="https://www.lab.fi/en/info">"en/info"</a> directory, relative
        to the current page. The browser will use the protocol and domain name
        of the current page to complete the URL.Relative URLs can be useful when
        linking to resources within the same website, as the links will still
        work even if the domain name changes. Absolute URLs are useful when
        linking to external resources, as the links will not break if the domain
        name changes.

          How is it possible to define the text visible on the top of a browsers
          window and/or on a tab? How about adding an icon next to the title?
          Give examples.
        </li>
      </h3>
      <p>
        The text that is visible on the top of a browser window and/or on a tab
        is called the title of the webpage, and it can be defined using the
        &lt;title&gt; element within the &lt;head&gt; section of an HTML
        document.
      </p>
      <p>Here is an example of how to set the title of a webpage:</p>
      <img src="/Images/Question4 answer.png" />
      <p>
        In this example, the title of the webpage is set to "19.2.2023" and it
        will be visible on the top of the browser window and on the tab. To add
        an icon next to the title, you can use a &lt;link&gt; element with a
        "shortcut icon" or "icon" rel attribute, and point it to the location of
        the icon file. The icon file should be in .ico, .png, or .svg format.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example: &lt;link rel="icon" href="/Images/LAB logo.png"
        type="image/png" /&gt;

        <li>
          How do blocklevel and inline level elements differ from each other?
          Give examples.
        </li>
      </h3>
      <p>
        In HTML, elements are either block-level or inline-level elements. The
        main difference between the two is how they are displayed on a web page
        and how they affect the layout of the surrounding content.
      </p>
      <h4>Block-level elements</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Take up the full width of their parent container, and create a new
          line after them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Common block-level elements include &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;,
          &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;li&gt;, &lt;form&gt; and
          &lt;header&gt;&lt;/header&gt;
        </li>
        <li>Examples:</li>
        <pre>
            <code>
            &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This is a block-level element&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It takes up the full width of its parent container&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;And creates a new line after it&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            <div>
                <p>This is a block-level element</p>
                <p>It takes up the full width of its parent container</p>
                <p>And creates a new line after it</p>
              </div>
            </code>
        </pre>
      </ul>
      <h4>Inline-level elements:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Only take up as much width as necessary, and do not create a new line
          after them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Common inline-level elements include &lt;span&gt;, &lt;a&gt;,
          &lt;strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;, &lt;img&gt; and &lt;input&gt;
        </li>
        <li>Examples:</li>
        <pre>
            <code>
                &lt;p&gt;This is an 
                &lt;span&gt;inline-level element&lt;/span&gt; 
                within a &lt;span&gt;block-level element&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                <p>This is an <span>inline-level element</span> within a <span>block-level element</span>  .</p>
            </code>
        </pre>
      </ul>

          Find out a piece of Java code and make it appear on your web page the
          same way it appears in a text editor.
        </li>
      </h3>
      <p>Here is some example of Java code:</p>
      <pre><code>public class Circle {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
          double radius = 5.0;
          double area = Math.PI * radius * radius;
          System.out.println("The area of a circle with radius " + radius + " is " + area);
        }
      }
      </code></pre>
      <h3>
        <li>
          There are three different ways of adding CSS styles on an (X)HTML
          page. How? What are the benefits of each way?
        </li>
      </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h4>Inline styles</h4>
        </li>
        <p>
          Inline styles are added directly to the HTML elements using the style
          attribute. They are useful when you need to apply a specific style to
          a single element and you don't want to create a separate CSS class for
          it.
        </p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <p>
          &lt;p style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;This is a blue
          paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
        </p>
        <li>
          <h4>Internal stylesheet</h4>
        </li>
        <p>
          An internal stylesheet is added to the &lt;head&gt; section of the
          HTML document using the &lt;style&gt; element. It is useful when you
          want to apply styles to multiple elements on the same HTML page and
          you don't need to reuse the styles on other pages.
        </p>
        <p>For Example:</p>
        <p>
          &lt;head&gt; &lt;style&gt; p { color: blue; } &lt;/style&gt;
          &lt;/head&gt;
        </p>
        <li>
          <h4>External stylesheet</h4>
        </li>
        <p>
          An external stylesheet is a separate CSS file that is linked to the
          HTML document using the &lt;link&gt; element in the &lt;head&gt;
          section of the HTML document. External stylesheets are useful when you
          want to apply styles to multiple pages or when you want to separate
          the presentation from the structure of the HTML document.
        </p>
        <p>For Example:</p>
        <p>
          &lt;head&gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;
          href=&quot;styles.css&quot;&gt; &lt;/head
        </p>
